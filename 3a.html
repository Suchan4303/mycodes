 A car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. It is designed to run on roads and 
typically has four wheels, with an internal combustion engine as the power source.

<h2 style="color:brown;">Types of Cars</h2>
 <ol>
 <li> <h3 style="color:orange;"><u>Sedan</u></h3><img

for cargo.A sedan is defined as a 4-door passenger car with a trunk that is separate from the 
passengers with a three-box body: the engine, the area for passengers, and the trunk. Throughout 
the generations, the definition of a sedan has been the same. Many sedans do offer a fold-down 
rear seatback that opens a pass-through to accommodate large objects that wouldn't normally fit 
in the trunk. But with the seatback in its upright position, the trunk is sealed off from access and 
prying eyes.</li>
 <li><h3 style="color:orange;"><u>SUV</u></h3><img

sport utility vehicles, are larger vehicles with a spacious interior and off-road capabilities.A sport 
utility vehicle (SUV) is a car classification that combines elements of road-going passenger cars 
with features from off-road vehicles, such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive.SUV 
is a loose term that traditionally covers a broad range of vehicles with four-wheel drive that can 
be taken off-road and have the feel of a lighter truck.</li>
 <li><h3 style="color:orange;"><u>Hatchback</u></h3> <img src="http://pop.hcdn.co/assets/17/20/1495147116-screen-shot-2017-05-18-at-63823-pm.png"height="300" 
width="500"></br>Hatchbacks have a rear door that opens upwards to provide access to the 
cargo area.The hatch is typically a liftgate with hinges on the top, so it is simple to open and pass 
cargo through. The primary advantage of a hatchback is that it allows easy access to cargo stored 
in the rear of the vehicleâ€™s interior.Hatchbacks had either two or four doors and a one-piece flipup tailgate, called a hatch, on their squared-off tails. Cars like the early VW Golfs, Renault Le 
Cars, Ford Escorts, and Dodge Omnis were typical of that breed.</li>
 <li><h3 style="color:orange;"><u>Hyundai Creta</u></h3><img

China, is a subcompact crossover SUV produced by Hyundai since 2014 mainly for emerging 
markets, particularly BRICS.Hyundai Creta is one of the best selling mid-size SUVs since it was 
first launched in the Indian market. It has become a common sight on our roads. Because of this 
many people have started customizing their Creta so that it stands out on the road.</li>
 <li><h3 style="color:orange;"><u>Tata Nexon</u></h3><img

subcompact crossover SUV produced by the Indian automaker Tata Motors since 2017.The base 
model of the TataNexon comes with some pretty standard features. The white accents along the 
foglamps, LED taillamps and side body plastic cladding are standard across variants. Also, 
except for the top-end XZ+ variant rest, all only get halogen headlamps and misses out on LED 
daytime running lights as well. </li>
